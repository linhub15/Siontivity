    <h2>About Sion Kim</h2>

    <p>Hi, my name is Sion Kim, Iâ€™m a 20 year old Visual Artist. Photography to me is a way to show others that creativity is limitless. For me I want to showcase my style and present a different side of Edmonton and how I view my surroundings through my images. I believe that there is no right or wrong way to create.</p>

    <p>I specialize in Portraits and Urban Editorial Work and would love to be introduced to new perspectives.</p>
