With only a month and half left of school to go, assignments and sessions have been piling up like crazy. The next few weeks I will be prioritizing what edits will come first and last. I will also have to hold off on any future sessions so that I have time to work on my&nbsp; images/assignments for school. I will be open to reschedule new shoots starting from April.30th
